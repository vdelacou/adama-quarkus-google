Adopting Trunk-Based Development
Trunk-based development is a version control strategy where all developers integrate their changes into a single branch (the "trunk") frequently. Here's how you can adopt this workflow:

Key Principles:
Single Branch (main): Use the main branch as the central point for all development.
Short-Lived Feature Branches (Optional): If needed, create short-lived branches that are merged back into main quickly.
Continuous Integration: Integrate and test changes frequently to detect issues early.
Feature Flags: Use feature toggles to deploy incomplete features safely.
Implementing Trunk-Based Development
Step 1: Set main as the Trunk
Ensure that your main branch is the primary branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Step 2: Regular Commits to main
Develop directly on the main branch or use short-lived feature branches.

Directly on main:

bash
Copy code
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
Using Short-Lived Branches:

bash
Copy code
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Delete the feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
Step 3: Continuous Integration
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and test your code whenever changes are pushed to main.

GitHub Actions: Use GitHub Actions to define workflows.
Other CI Tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
Sample .github/workflows/ci.yml File:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '11'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install
Place this file in the .github/workflows/ directory in your adama repository.

Step 4: Feature Flags
Use feature flags to merge incomplete features safely.

Libraries: Consider using libraries like FF4J or Unleash for feature toggling.
Implementation: Wrap new feature code with conditionals that check if the feature is enabled.
